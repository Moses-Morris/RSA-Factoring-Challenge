RSA Factoring Challenge


- RSA Factoring.
RSA factoring: the ultimate encryption solution developed by mathematicians and calculated by developers.


RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptography algorithm in the world. It is also one of the most secure, with only a few known attacks that can be used to break it. but this is by design and not by accident.

Prime Factorization (or integer factorization) is a commonly used mathematical problem often used to secure public-key encryption systems. A common practice is to use very large semi-primes (that is, the result of the multiplication of two prime numbers) as the number securing the encryption. In order to break it, they would have to find the prime factorization of the large semi-prime number – that is, two or more **prime numbers** that multiplied together result in the original number.

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.

Very simply, HTTPS uses Secure Socket Layer to encrypt data that is transferred between client and server. SSL uses the RSA algorithm.

The server generates two large prime numbers, and multiplies them together. This is called the "public key". This key is made available to any client which wishes to transmit data securely to the server. The client uses this "public key" to encrypt data it wishes to send.
